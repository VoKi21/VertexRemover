# VertexRemover
Reads .obj file, removes vertices, writes .obj file\n
I use the project from here: https://github.com/kv1tr4vn/CGVSU/tree/main/Task3/ObjReaderInitial \n
I don't know how to make forks or should I make a fork, so I'll just leave a link to the original project. Hope the author won't sue me\n
